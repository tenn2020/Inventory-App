# User Manuel

This application runs on any Android OS phone that has API 21 or above. The app functionality depends on the type of user. The Customer user type can only search products in the database, and the Employee user type can search, add, delete, and edit products in the database. 

When you open the app, the first screen displayed is the login page that allows the user of the app to select one of the two options: Customer or Employee.

If the user selects Customer, the user will be directed to a screen that displays all the products that the store offers, and in addition, it has a Search button at the top of the screen.

If the Employee user selects the Add button (+), the user will be directed to a screen that inquires the user to make a selection in a hierarchal layout: Floor Category, Floor Type, and additional attributes depending on the selected Floor Category. Once the user selects all the necessary attributes for the product to be added and presses the Add button, this information will be added to the database.

If the Customer or Employee user selects one of the products from the list, the user will be directed to a screen that displays more details about the selected product.
