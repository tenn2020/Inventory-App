# Project Plan

**Author**: \<Team 1\>

## 1 Introduction

Flooring Inc. is a company that sells different types of floors such as wood, tile, stone, vinyl, and laminate. The company reached out to our team to develop an android application that could track and update their inventory.
## 2 Process Description

- Develop an initial project plan

  During this phase, we will review the requirements and develop a class diagram to represent the system requested by the client. 

  - Entrance Criteria: Get the system requirements from the client.
  - Exit Criteria: Develop UML diagrams, an initial use case model, and an initial test plan according to the requirements.

- Elaboration

  During this phase, we will develop a project plan and identify and assign roles to team members. We will create a use case model, a test plan, design the architecture of the system, identify constraints and design considerations, and create supplemental diagrams. We will also create a mock of the GUI that will be used for the system.

  - Entrance Criteria: Class diagram, understanding of the requirements.
  - Exit Criteria: Supplemental UML diagrams, use case model, test plan, project plan

- Construction

  During this phase, we will create an initial version of the application, and begin executing the test plan. We will also revise previously created documents if necessary. We will also create a user manual for the application.

  - Entrance Criteria: Project plan, the product from a previous iteration of this phase
  - Exit Criteria: Test case results, an iteration plan for the next iteration of this phase, updated initial version of the application.

- Transition

  During this phase we will test the application extensively, finalize the user manual, and deliver the final product to the client. 

  - Entrance Criteria: Latest version of the application
  - Exit Criteria: Updated documents, final version of the application that passes all test cases.
